<h1>★ My Change: ★</h1>

<p>My change allows the user to turn on "Zen Mode", which acts as a practice tool. When zen mode is enabled, the score and round number isn't tracked, allowing the user to play as much as they want without having to worry about score.'</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
